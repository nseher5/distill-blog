Here is an approach for individual and team reflection that I’ve used on projects with some success. It is a two part process; an individual reflection on personal and team performance by each team member, followed by a round robin team discussion.\r\nIndividual reflection\r\nSupports individual reflection on your time on the project. It also forces you to structure your thoughts and think through lessons learnt to share with your team. Each team member identifies the following:\r\nWhat went well? What tasks did you enjoy? What achievements can be celebrated? Think about stakeholder interaction, ways of working, deliverables, project goals, workshops etc.\r\nWhat didn’t go so well? What challenges did we face? What were the moments when you felt stuck? Why were they frustrating? Were the challenges technical, business-related, communication-related, or politics?\r\nWhat can I take away? What did you learn from the challenges you faced on this project? How can you improve on the challenge you faced to improve future projects? What were your personal learning goals for this project or sprint?\r\n(For Managers) What could I have done better to support and advocate for my team and project goals?\r\nTemplate\r\n\r\nTeam reflection\r\nShare project experiences and reflections as a team, identifying areas for celebration and opportunities for improvement to facilitate team consensus on project impact. Classify experiences along four quadrants in a matrix:\r\nWhat went well? - Keep doing and improve on current processes, celebrate acheivements\r\nWhat didn’t go so well?\r\nActions Lessons learnt, improvement opportunities, plan to tackle roadblocks\r\nTemplate\r\n\r\nProject Wrap up Meeting\r\nBefore the meeting\r\nSet up a Project Wrap Up meeting\r\nClarify purpose, agenda of the meeting\r\nAsk the team to fill out individual reflection template ~15 minutes\r\n\r\nDuring the meeting\r\nClarify purpose and agenda of the meeting\r\nSet the time period under discussion (last sprint, last quarter)\r\nCommunicate ground rules ~ 5 minutes\r\nDont take it personally\r\nEveryone’s experience is valid\r\nGo with an open mind\r\nFocus on improvements rather than placing blame\r\n\r\nAsk team members to share what went well, what didn’t go well and actions in a rapid round robin ~ 30 minutes\r\nUpdate team reflection template in real-time\r\n\r\nAfter the meeting\r\nAfter the meeting, send out team reflection document to the team\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nRetrospectives take 30-60 minutes and can have a great impact on team performance, growth and motivation. It has personally helped me reflect on the work I’ve done for the past 3-6 months, critically think about my achievements and mistakes I wont repeat on my next project.\r\nSources: Data Science and Agile (What Works, and What Doesn’t) by Eugene Yan, Altassan Retrospectives\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
